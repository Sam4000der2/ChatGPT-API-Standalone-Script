# ChatGPT-API-Standalone-Script
To communicate with the ChatGPT API, I created standalone scripts without external modules.  

Easy to customize and you don't have to rely on third-party developers.  

The first script is a PowerShell script. A Linux script will follow.

I am open for further suggestions.
